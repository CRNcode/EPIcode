# EPIcode

This repository of C/C++ code was developed for the stochastic simulation, mainly using Gillespie's direct algorithm, of epidemic models in metapopulations with an underlying network structure. It was used to generate the simulations described in the preprint *Outbreak dynamics and population vulnerability in stochastic epidemic models on networks* (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13730>), with Makoto Ueki and Robin Thompson.
